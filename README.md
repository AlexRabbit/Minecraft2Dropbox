----
Our most value thing: our ```.minecraft``` folder.
Whit this script (or .exe) you will be able to make a backup of the whole ```.minecraft``` folder right to your ```Dropbpbox/Minecraft``` directory.

You don't have to do anything but to double-click.

Just keep in mind:

- [ ] It doesn't gonna work if you changed the Dropbox path when you first install Dropbox.

- [ ] This app makes the process of copying automatically but it doesn't schedule it. 
**BUT** [You can make it run when starting your computer.](https://www.ionos.com/digitalguide/server/configuration/startup-folder-in-windows-10/)
